Russian roulette, but with boost. Everyone loves having RNG in their competitive games.

## What is this?

---

Boost Roulette is a [BakkesMod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/) plugin for Rocket League on PC.
The plugin changes the way boost works sometimes.
Whenever someone picks up boost, there is a chance they will be demolished.  

By default, the demo chance depends on the type of boost:  

- Big boost: 1 / 6 = ~16.7%
- Small pads: 1 / 28 = ~3.6%

You can easily change the probabilities in the plugin window.

## How to Use

---

The Boost Roulette plugin is disabled by default. To enable it:

1. Open up the BakkesMod window (F2)
2. Go to the ```Plugins``` tab
3. Click on ```Boost Roulette Plugin```
4. Click the checkbox under ```Enable Boost Roulette Plugin```

Now, it should work!  

You can move the sliders to change the probability of demo per type of boost.

**If you are having any issues, I've listed solutions to common problems below.**

### Help: The checkbox and probability sliders are not showing up in the plugin window

Most likely, the plugin loaded without refreshing the setting files.  

1. Close the BakkesMod window and open up the BakkesMod console (F6).
2. Make sure the plugin is loaded by entering ```plugin load boostrouletteplugin```
3. Refresh the settings files by entering ```cl_settings_refreshplugins```.
4. The checkbox and sliders should appear now!

### Help: The ```Install with BakkesMod``` button isn't working

You will have to install the plugin manually. Don't worry. I made a quick video to show you how!  
TODO add a link to the video

### Help: How do I play with friends?

You will have to host your own lobby to use the plugin with friends. I recommend using [RocketPlugin](https://bakkesplugins.com/plugins/view/26). You have to do this because private matches are hosted on Psyonix's servers, so plugins will not work on their servers.

Only the host needs to have Boost Roulette installed, but to keep it easy for everyone, I recommend everyone installs RocketPlugin.
